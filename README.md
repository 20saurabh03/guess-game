# guess-game
This is a simple guessing game built with JavaScript. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess the number. The game provides hints if the player's guess is too high or too low. This project was created as part of the #30daysof30projects coding challenge. Feel free to check out the code and try the game for yourself!
